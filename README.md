The associate python script is comprised of two parts, organized in a Jupyter Notebook. In Part A, market data for IVV is downloaded from Yahoo Finance for January of 2025 (January 1 through January 31). Once the dataset has been prepared, the IVV price and volume are plotted as a candle stick and bar graph, respectively, using mplfinance. The chart is formatted to meet desired specifications. In Part B, the script ingests stock market data contained in a CSV file. Focusing on AAPL, only the 'Trading Day' and 'AAPL' columns are retained. Starting from trading day 21, a prior 20 day moving average and standard deviation is computed for each trading day. Using these values, lower and upper bands are calculated. Lastly, these results are plotted using matplotlib, and the chart is formatted to meet the required specifications.
